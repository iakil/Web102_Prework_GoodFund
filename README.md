## Notes

Creating, adding, implementing functionality and design was very straigtforward. Its definitely refreshed my memory of html, css and js. I had to research about filter and reduce methods, but afterward I realized the benefits of it, which make the website more efficient. In this prework, I learned JavaScript features such as template literals, functions, filter, map, reduce, destructuring and spread operators, logic evaluation.
